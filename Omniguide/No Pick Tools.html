                <li>It is important to utilize your coworkers knowledge, especially other fulfillment associates. Be persistent when asking for help, call for people by name, and be sure to always verify for yourself. Don’t just take people for their word alone.</li>

                <li>RFID is a program that uses radio frequency to track certain items. At this time, only Nike and Adidas apparel and footwear. This program is extremely useful in finding no picks when the department is not organized.</li>
                <li>To use RFID, you need to have a TC72 and an RFID gun. Both are located in the manager's office. Then, open the Clarity app on the TC. Clarity uses your A-number login.</li>
                <li>Once you have logged in, you will need to pair the RFID gun and TC together if using for the first time. Go to the Peripherals tab. The RFID gun may have previously been paired so you can select the gun from there. </li>
                <li>Press and hold the bluetooth button on the RFID gun until it is blinking blue. Then click pair with the TC. Once it has found the gun, click the pair on the screen and click the gun's trigger. It should be connected from there.</li>
                <li>Once the gun is paired, you can begin searching for an item. Go to the Item Search tab.</li>
                <li>Type the SKU into the search bar to find the product in our inventory directory. Then, select the size and color you are looking for. The RFID gun will activate and begin searching for the frequency.</li>
                <li>The gun will make a 'geiger' beeping noise once it has latched on to the frequency. The sound will increase in frequency and the percentage meter on the TC will go higher the closer you are to the tag.</li>
                <li><strong>NOTE: Try to avoid switching tabs on the TC while working on finding an object in Clarity. The software can become glitchy and crash if switching around too much.</strong></li>

                  <li>Item Lookup provides a lot of relevant information about trouble items that you can use to aid your search:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Last received dates:</strong> You can tell how recent an item is in the store, maybe it just came off the last truck and hasn’t been worked out yet, or if its too old it may be an unlikely pick.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location of Item:</strong> If applicable, it will show the department and Pog ID for the item. Softlines (clothes/footwear) do not have an item location, but most hardgoods do. Department “Impact Areas” are anything facing the race track, the changing front door flat, and check-out lines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales Information:</strong> This gives how many of the items were sold within 90 days. This can be used to give an idea on how many were in the store and moved out of the store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merchandise Hierarchy:</strong> This can clarify what an item is if you are unsure by the name alone.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>It is recommended to use Item Lookup to learn the different Pog ID departments around the store so you are familiar with each aisle's planogram.</li>

                  <li>DART Datascan is our post-summary database from our annual inventory. In DART, it can tell you how many of an item was scanned and the exact location it was scanned in. The further from the inventory date you get, the more inaccurate DART becomes. However, hardgoods generally remain unchanged so it is worth a look.</li>
                  <li>Within the months of September, October, and November, team members can access DART from an approved device to find the exact location that items were scanned in during inventory.</li>
                  <li>Keep in mind that the further from the annual inventory date stickers have been removed, items have been moved, and planograms have been reset.</li>
