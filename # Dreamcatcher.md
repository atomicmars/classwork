# Concept Web Catcher

## Introduction
---
The concept for this idea comes from my own desire to have a way to organize my thoughts in a way that allows for more movement between sections than a typical word document allows. I have created lengthy reference documents with a table of contents when managing ideas and information I want to use later on. I always think to myself "theres got to be a better way to store and move between ideas" as I'm searching for one line in particular. This project will attempt to remedy this.

## Description
---
This application is intended to become an organized location for managing ideas - text and visual -- and allowing the user to move freely between these components

## Visualization

![alt text](<PROJECT VISUALIZATION-1.png>)
The concept is based off a spiderweb, where our data input is the connection points between threads. Ideally, I want to be able to zoom and exit between the sections within a cluster.
